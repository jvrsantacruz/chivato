# Chi`vat`o

This is the new VAT number Python validator.

Every company in every country has a national _vat_ id number.
They all follow their own scheme and formats and names.
Some have a control system which might be computed.
Among all this diversity and dissimilarity.
At some point, you'll get some wrong.
This is a problem.

This code is heavily based on the [vatnumber](http://code.google.com/p/vatnumber/) package code.
Kudos to CÃ©dric Krier for his thorough work.
