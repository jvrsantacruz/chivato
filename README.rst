Chi\ ``vat``\ o
===============

This is the new VAT number Python validator.

Every company in every country has a national *vat* id number. They all
follow their own scheme and formats and names. Some have a control
system which might be computed. Among all this diversity and
dissimilarity. At some point, you'll get some wrong. This is a problem.

This code is heavily based on the
`vatnumber <http://code.google.com/p/vatnumber/>`_ package code. Kudos
to CÃ©dric Krier for his thorough work.
